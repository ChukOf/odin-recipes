    <h1>Homemade Lasagna</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a 
        deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have found 
        none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad 
        and crusty garlic bread.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Meat</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Canned Tomotoes</li>
        <li>Fresh Herbs</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Spices and seasonings</li>
        <li>Noodles</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Cook the meat: Cook the ground meat in a skillet until browned and crumbly. Add the 
            onion and continue cooking until it's translucent. Stir in the canned tomato products, 
            half of the parsley, garlic, basil, 1.5 teaspoons of salt, 
            oregano, and sugar.
        </li>
        <li>Cook the noodles: Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly 
            salted water until they're al dente.
        </li>
        <li>Make the cheese layer: Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, the remaining parsley, 
            the remaining salt, and 
            pepper in a bowl.
        </li>
        <li> Assemble the lasagna: Layer the ingredients according to the recipe (starting with 
            sauce and ending with mozzarella) until 
            the lasagna is assembled.
        </li>
        <li>Bake the lasagna: Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven for about half an hour. Remove the foil and 
            continue baking until the top is golden brown.
        </li>
        <li>In an oven preheated to 375 degrees F, this homemade 
            lasagna should be perfectly baked in about 50 minutes (30-40 minutes covered, 
            5-10 minutes uncovered).
        </li>
    </ol>
