# Odin Recipes

This project is part of The Odin Project Foundations course.

The goal of this project is to build a basic recipe website using HTML.
It will demonstrate my understanding of:
- HTML structure
- Using headings, paragraphs, lists, and links
- Organizing files and directories
- Using Git and GitHub for version control

By the end of this project, I will have practiced creating a simple
multi-page website and managing it with Git.
